	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Laavanya</span> (she/her) and I'm  working on my PhD in Genetics & Genomics</p>
	<p>I'm currently a fourth year Genetics and Genomics PhD candidate at Duke University Dr. Tim Reddy's lab. I am currently studying the genetics behind polycystic ovarian syndrome. I am interested in genetic regulation, functional characterization of genetic variants with a human health/women's health context.
		
		I am also interested in biology education, and emrolled in Duke's Certificate for College Teaching program. I have taugt lab sections for introductory molecular biology and have mentored several undergraduate students. I encourage focusing on curiosity-driven discussion, and ethical considerations of genetics research in my class.</p>
